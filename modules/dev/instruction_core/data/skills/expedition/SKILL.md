# Expedition

Export ADHD Framework agents and instructions to external projects.

## When to Use
- Exporting agents/instructions to a Vue3, React, Unity, Rust, Go, or other external project
- Running the 8-phase expedition pipeline
- Adapting ADHD patterns for non-ADHD ecosystems

## Key Concepts
- **L1 Bundle Architecture**: Target projects remain pristine; sidecar owns all ADHD infrastructure
- **8-Phase Pipeline**: Scout → Readiness → Planning → Feasibility → 🛑 → Execution → Verification → 🛑 → Registry → 🛑 → MCP
- **Chunk execution**: ≤5 files/batch, ≤25 artifacts per expedition

## Resources
- See `expedition_schemas.instructions.md` for artifact schemas and validation rules
- See `hyper_exped_reference.instructions.md` for runtime reference and edge cases
