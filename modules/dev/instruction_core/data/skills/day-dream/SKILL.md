# Day Dream

Blueprint authoring and vision planning for the ADHD Framework.

## When to Use
- Creating a new blueprint (day-dream) plan
- Authoring feature specs, architecture docs, or implementation plans
- Building supporting assets (diagrams, data models, API specs)
- Conceptualizing long-term vision or roadmaps

## Key Concepts
- **Blueprint Structure**: `00_index.md` → `01_executive_summary.md` → `02_architecture.md` → feature files → `80_implementation.md`
- **Assets**: Supporting materials stored in `assets/` alongside blueprint files
- **Feature Files**: Each feature gets its own numbered file with story, spec, and acceptance criteria

## Resources
- See `dream_blueprint.instructions.md` for blueprint authoring rules
- See `dream_assets.instructions.md` for asset creation guidelines
